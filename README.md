# Pangenome genotyping of structural variants and molecular QTL mapping

Structural variants are known to play a large role in expression and splicing QTL.
However, confidently calling stuctural variants in a sufficiently large population for association mapping is hard.
Here we use [PanGenie](https://github.com/eblerjana/pangenie) to genotype a larger cohort (100s) of short reads using an accurate pangenome panel from haplotype-resolved assemblies (10s).
